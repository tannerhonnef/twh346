`twh346` is the package that I am developing for the coursework component of
GEOG 246-346 (Geospatial Analysis with R).

The first function it has is, `my_number_checker`, which is executed as follows:

```{r}
library(twh346)
my_number_checker(1)
my_number_checker(7)
my_number_checker(20)
```

In addition, it has `my_multiplier` which is executed as follows:
```{r}
library(twh346)
my_multiplier(1)
my_multiplier(7)
my_multiplier(20)
```

Another new function I have added is `my_calc`:
```{r}
library(twh346)
my_calc(5, 7, "sum")
my_calc(10, 2, "divide")
my_calc(2, 5, "multiply")
my_calc(7, 5, "subtract")
```

I will be adding others, and updating this vignette as we go.
